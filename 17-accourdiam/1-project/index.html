                <p class="desc">Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps.</p>

                <summary>What are The Different Types of Web Development?</summary>
                <p class="desc">It is essential to first grasp the three primary forms of web development before diving into the practice of web development itself and talk about the many kinds and technologies that go along with them. 

                    Front-End Development
                    Back-End Development

                <summary>What is the difference between front-end development and back-end development?</summary>
                <p class="desc">Front-end development refers to the surface-level elements, the things you can see: Page format, color schemes, and so on.
                    Back-end development is where you lay out all the behind-the-scenes, technical elements of your site. If your site features an image gallery, for example, you must store those image files somewhere — and back-end development is where you set up that storage space.</p>

                <p class="desc">Do you remember the time when web development was easy? Right where it all started, when there was just one browser, and only one website existed?

                    Things changed. And now you can't trust anything any longer. Trust me, if you think you know how your site will be shown, you're wrong. Just consider the 10 major steps of "progress" we've made since then:</p>

                <summary>How does a web developer work?</summary>
                <p class="desc">Web developers create functional, user-friendly websites and web applications. They may write code, develop and test new applications, or monitor site performance and traffic. Front-end developers focus on the user-facing side of their work, while back-end developers make websites functional and secure.</p>
